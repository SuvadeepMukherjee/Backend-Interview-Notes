# REST API -CORS,Serialization,Desrialization,Others

### Q1: What is CORS in Restful APIs ? 

**Answer**: CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is a *security feature* implemented in web browsers that *restrict web pages or scripts from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page*

### Q2: How to remove CORS restrictions in RESTful APIs 

**Answer**: CORS restrictions can be removed by enabling CORS middleware in application

```javascript
const express = require("express");

const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();

//enable CORS middleware for all routes

app.use(cors());

//optionally configure cors to allow requests from specific origins

//now cors will allow requests from discord.com

app.use(

  cors({

â€‹    origin: "https://discord.com",

  })

);
```

### Q3: What is Serialization and Deserialization ?

| Serialization                                                | Deserialization                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
