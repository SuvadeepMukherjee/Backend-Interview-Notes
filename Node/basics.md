# Basics 



### Q1: What is the difference between realtive path and absolute path ? 

**Answer**: Following are the differences between relative path and ansolute path 

- Relative path: Specifies the location of a file or directory *relative* to the current working directory.
- Absolute path: Specifies the *complete path* of a file or directory from the root directory of the file system.

###### Create a server with Node ? 

```javascript

const http = require("http");

const requestListener = (req, res) => {

res.writeHead(200);

res.send("Hello World");

};

const server = http.createServer(requestListener);

server.listen(3000, () => {

console.log("Server is running on port 3000");

});
```

###### What do you mean by Node.js Event driven architecture ? 

event emitters emit events , These events are picked by event listeners which fires off callback functions attached to each event listen 

###### What is the observer pattern in Javascript programming ?

event emitter emits events which are picked up by event listeners which fires off callback functions attached to each event listener 

###### What does process.exit() do ? 

terminates the current node process with the specified exit code 

###### When would you use -- save -dev and when would you use -- save

-- save - dev to install packages which we need during development like nodemon

-- save to install packages that we need during production like express

###### List 5 advantages of node 

1. high perfoirmance
2. highly scalable 
3. single language 
4. rich ecosystem
5. real time applications 

###### HTTP Methods 

| HTTP Methods | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GET          | requests data from a server                                  |
| POST         | submits data to be processed to a specified resource         |
| PUT          | replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content |
| DELETE       | deletes the specified resource                               |

###### Which module is used to read and write operations ?

fs 

###### How many types of API functions are there in Node ? 

| Type                           | Description                                                  | Example         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| asynchronous , non-blocking    | Operate asynchronously. Node.js doesnâ€™t get blocked while waiting for data. Continues to move to the next API call. | fs.readFile     |
| synchronous blocking functions | Act as blocking functions. Application waits for a response until the value is returned | fs.readFileSync |
